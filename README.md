## 🧐 How It Works

- **Data Retrieval**: Uses Zerodha's Kite Connect API to fetch real-time holdings data.
- **Data Analysis**: Computes key metrics like total investment, current value, and net P&L.
- **News Summarization**: Scrapes and summarizes the latest news using Gemini or Serper.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Users ask questions in plain English, and the AI responds contextually.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Local Processing**: All data stays on your machine or server.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive tokens are managed securely.
- **Read-Only Access**: Uses only read permissions from Zerodha.

## 🤚🏼 Comparison with Zerodha's MCP Integration

While Zerodha's Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows integration with assistants like Claude, it has limitations:

| Feature                     | Zerodha MCP + Claude | PortfolioGPT (This Project) |
|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Open Source**            | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                   |
| **Full Customization**     | ❌ Limited         | ✅ Full control          |
| **Privacy & Local Control**| ❌ Cloud Only      | ✅ 100% local            |
| **Real-Time Price Analysis**| ❌ Delayed/static | ✅ Live with yFinance    |
| **Debug/Extend**           | ❌ Not possible    | ✅ Developer friendly     |
